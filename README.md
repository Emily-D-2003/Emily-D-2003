- 👋 Hi, I’m Emily! I was born in the states and raised in Shanghai, China. 
- 👀 I'm a huge fan of behavioral science, madly in love with the "why"s behind human thoughts, feelings, and decision-makings.
- 🌱 I’m currently a student at Swarthmore College, studying Psychology and Economics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Behavioral Econ research!!
- 📫 Reach me at em.dai@outlook.com if you ever want to collaborate, dance House or Hip-hop, or have a good time together!
